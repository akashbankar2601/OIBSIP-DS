TASK 1 : UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

OVERVEW : The primary objective of this project is focused on examining the unemployment rate, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Unemployment, a pivotal economic metric, is measured by the Unemployment rate which is the number of people who are Unemployed as a percentage if the total labour force.. Through a comprehensive analysis of unemployment trends and influencing factors, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the job market and the larger economic landscape. 

PROJECT INTRODUCTION : The primary objective of this project is to analyze the unemployment rate during the Covid-19 pandemic. The project will involve collecting relevant data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) 

REQUIREMENTS - To run the notebooks and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,etc.)


TASK 2 :  CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

PROJECT INTRODUCTION: Predicting the price of cars based on a wide range of attributes and features. Using a dataset containing car details such as safety ratings, dimensions, engine specifications, and more, we aim to develop a machine learning model that accurately estimates the price of different car models.

REQUIREMENTS: To run the notebooks and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn etc.)


TASK 3 : IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

PROJECT INTRODUCTION : To create a model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

REQUIREMENTS: To run the notebooks and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn etc.)
